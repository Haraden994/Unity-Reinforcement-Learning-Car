# Unity-Reinforcement-Learning-Car
Unity Project made for "Metodi Statistici per l'Apprendimento" course in Universit√† degli Studi di Milano.

The scope of the project is to experiment the usage of Unity ML-Agents library in order to develop an Artificial Intelligence for Videogames that learns through Reinforcement Learning process.

The final result is a Car that learns how to drive through different racing tracks thanks to a camera system that serves as input for the Convolutional Neural Network used in ML-Agents.
